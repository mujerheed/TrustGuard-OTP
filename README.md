# TrustGuard: A Zero-Trust OTP Verification System for Informal Social Media E-commerce  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview  
In Nigeria, Social media vendors uses **WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook** as informal e-commerce platforms using posts, reels, or statuses.  
Customers places order via **DMs**, payment done by **bank transfer**, and send **receipts or alert message screenshot** as proof.

**ðŸ”¹ Problem:**  
- Difficult to verify if a customer or vendor is genuine.  
- Payment receipts can be fake (edited screenshots).
- No authentication or verification layer before transactions.   

**ðŸ”¹ Proposed Solution:**  
This project introduces **TrustGuard**, a security system based on:  
- **OTP Authentication (alphanumeric code via email/SMS)**  
- **Least Privilege Access (Zero Trust security model)**  
- **Optional receipt validation (hashing / transaction lookup)**  

The goal is to **increase trust** in social media e-commerce transactions, while serving as a **project-based learning system** for cybersecurity students.

## ðŸ”¹Tech Stack

- Backend: Python (Flask / FastAPI / Django)
- Frontend: React.js / Flask templates
- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL
- Security: JWT, RBAC, PyOTP, Hashlib
- Cloud Deployment: AWS / GCP / Azure
- Optional Services: Twilio (SMS OTP), SendGrid (Email OTP)

## ðŸš€ Workflow

### ðŸ”¹ Buyer Flow
1. Buyer sees product â†’ sends a DM to vendor.
2. Business bot requests buyer details:  
   - Name  
   - Phone Number  
   - Address  
3. OTP is generated & sent via WhatsApp, SMS, or Email.  
4. Buyer enters OTP â†’ verified as genuine.  
5. Buyer transfers payment & sends receipt/alert to vendor.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Vendor Flow
1. Vendor receives buyerâ€™s details and payment receipt.  
2. TrustGuard verifies if the receipt/alert is **real** (rule-based + AI fraud detection).  
3. Vendor confirms transaction or rejects if fake.  
4. Vendor manages orders via a **dashboard** (OTP login).  

---

### ðŸ”¹ CEO Flow (High-Value Transactions)
1. If transaction > defined threshold (e.g., $1000), CEO intervention is required.  
2. CEO logs into the dashboard with a **digit-based OTP** (higher privilege).  
3. CEO approves or rejects large transactions.  
4. CEO manages vendor accounts, buyer logs, and transaction records.
