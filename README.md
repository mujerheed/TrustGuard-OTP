# TrustGuard: A Zero-Trust OTP Verification System for Informal Social Media E-commerce  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview  
In Nigeria, Social media vendors uses **WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook** as informal e-commerce platforms using posts, reels, or statuses.  
Customers places order via **DMs**, payment done by **bank transfer**, and send **receipts or alert message screenshot** as proof.

**ðŸ”¹ Problem:**  
- Difficult to verify if a customer or vendor is genuine.  
- Payment receipts can be fake (edited screenshots).
- No authentication or verification layer before transactions.   

**ðŸ”¹ Proposed Solution:**  
This project introduces **TrustGuard**, a security system based on:  
- **OTP Authentication (alphanumeric code via email/SMS)**  
- **Least Privilege Access (Zero Trust security model)**  
- **Optional receipt validation (hashing / transaction lookup)**  

The goal is to **increase trust** in social media e-commerce transactions, while serving as a **project-based learning system** for cybersecurity students.
